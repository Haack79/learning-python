# data types
# int - integer - whole number   1
# float - floating point - decimal point   1.0
# str - string - text   "1"
# bool - boolean - true or false   True
# list - list - ordered collection of values   [1, 2, 3]
# dict - dictionary - unordered collection of key/value pairs   {"name": "John", "age": 30}
# tuple - tuple - ordered immutable collection of values   (1, 2, 3)
# set - set - unordered collection of unique values   {1, 2, 3}
# NoneType - None - represents the absence of a value   None
# Classes and Objects - classes build objects
# class - a blueprint for creating objects
# object - an instance of a class
# specialized data types - classes are specialized data types - classes are a way to create your own data types - classes are a way to create your own objects
# can use them from other files - classes can be imported from other files or modules

# INT 3 + 4  -
print(3 + 4)
print(type(3 + 4))
# float 3.0 + 4.0  - has decimal takes more space in memory, cause of that decimal, both sides on the point are stored in memory in different places
print(2**2)  # 2 to the power of 2
print(5 // 4)  # floor division - rounds down to the nearest whole number
print(6 % 4)  # modulo - returns the remainder after division
# STR "3" + "4" - concatenation - joining two strings together
# math functions - built in functions that perform mathematical operations on numbers - math functions take numbers as arguments and return numbers as return values
# abs() - returns the absolute value of a number
# pow() - returns the result of raising a number to a power
# abs(23.5)  # 23.5
# round(23.5)  # 24
# abs(-23.5)  # 23.5 - absolute value returns positive  -23.5
# Operator precedence - PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction
# complex numbers - complex numbers are numbers with a real and imaginary part - complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part
# only use complex numbers if you need them - complex numbers are not used very often in programming - complex numbers are used in scientific and engineering applications
print(bin(5))
print(
    int("0b101", 2)
)  # 5 - base 2 binary number system - 0b101 is the binary representation of the number 5 - 0b101 is a string - 2 is the base stored as an integer
# variables - variables are used to store values - variables are like boxes that store values - variables are like labels that point to values - variables are like nicknames for values
# snake_case - snake case is a naming convention where words are separated by underscores - snake case is used for variable names in python
# start with a letter or underscore - variable names must start with a letter or underscore
# case sensitive - variable names are case sensitive - my_variable is not the same as My_Variable or MY_VARIABLE
# don't overwrite keywords - don't use python keywords for variable names - keywords are reserved words that have a special meaning in python
# don't overwrite built-in functions - don't use python built-in functions for variable names - built-in functions are functions that are built into python
# start with _ for private variables - variables that start with an underscore are private variables - private variables are variables that are only accessible inside the class or object
# start with lowercase for regular variables - variables that start with a lowercase letter are regular variables - regular variables are variables that are accessible outside the class or object
# constants - constants are variables that are not meant to be changed - constants are variables that are meant to stay the same - constants are variables that are not meant to be reassigned
# constants are written in all caps - constants are written in all capital letters - constants are written in all uppercase letters
# dunder variables - dunder variables are variables that start and end with double underscores - dunder variables are special variables that have a special meaning in python
# a,b,c = 1,2,3 - multiple assignment - multiple assignment is assigning multiple variables at once
# expressions - expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators - expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators that evaluate to a single value
# expressions evaluate to a value
# statements - statements are instructions that perform some action - statements are instructions that perform some action - statements are instructions that perform some action
# statements  iq = 150 is statement
# augmented assignment operator - augmented assignment operators are used to perform an operation on a variable and then assign the result to the same variable - augmented assignment operators are used to perform an operation on a variable and then assign the result to the same variable
# augmented assignment operator  iq += 10 is augmented assignment operator
