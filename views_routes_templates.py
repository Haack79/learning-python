# views in python are functions that take a request and return a response - the request is an object that contains information about the incoming request - the response is an object that contains information about the outgoing response
# # the way to work with different front end frameworks is to use a REST API - REST stands for Representational State Transfer - REST is an architectural style for building APIs
# templates are used to generate HTML dynamically - templates are files that contain HTML with placeholders for dynamic data - templates are rendered by the web framework and returned as a response to the client
# routes are used to map URLs to views - routes are defined in the web framework and are used to map URLs to views - routes are used to determine which view should handle a request
# an example of a route is /shibes - this route would map to a view that returns a list of shibe images
