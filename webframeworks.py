# webframeworks are the main entry point for the web application and are responsible for routing requests to the correct controller and returning the response to the client. The web framework is also responsible for handling errors and exceptions that occur during the request/response cycle.
# most popular web frameworks for Python are Flask and Django. Flask is a microframework that is easy to get started with and is very flexible. Django is a full-stack framework that is more opinionated and comes with a lot of features out of the box.
